2023-11-01,low,low,low,"The only place where you can trigger an avalanche is on high-elevation wind-drifted slopes. These places will be easy to identify by textured, wind-hardened surfaces. Although the chance of triggering an avalanche is really small, remember that a short ride in a small avalanche in early-season conditions can be dangerous."
2023-11-02,moderate,moderate,low,"Avalanche conditions are most dangerous on wind-drifted north and northeast-facing slopes at higher elevations. These areas have a weak, collapsible layer of snow near the ground underneath thicker, more cohesive slabs. Visible cracking and/or audible collapsing indicate areas where you can trigger an avalanche. Slopes less than around 30 degrees in steepness, wind-sheltered slopes, or sunnier aspects that did not hold early-October snow all offer safer riding options. Watch for shallowly-buried obstacles with thin early-season coverage."
2023-11-02,low,low,low,"The areas where you may be most tempted to travel are where you are most likely to trigger an avalanche. You should avoid steep slopes where the wind has drifted snow, and you find continuous coverage that feels supportive yet hollow and may crack beneath you. You are most likely to see these conditions in gullies and below ridgelines in alcoves shaded from the sun and wind. Avalanches will be small, but a ride through rocks may result in an early end to your season."
2023-11-02,low,low,low,"Most slopes are free from avalanches simply due to the lack of snow cover. High-elevation wind-drifted slopes are the only places you may be able to trigger an avalanche. Avoid gully features or places where you observe smooth drifted pockets of snow or a wind-hardened surface. Although the chance of triggering an avalanche is small, even a small avalanche in early-season conditions can lead to an unforgiving ride."

Slopes with wind-drifted, stiffer slabs are the most dangerous, but you can trigger an avalanche even in wind-sheltered areas with a snowpack deeper than about three feet. Look for drifts of snow below ridgelines and in cross-loaded features. The slabs are thicker and avalanches will be larger at higher elevations. You can trigger a slide that breaks in the upper snowpack which might then release deeper, near the ground.On Sunday, February 11, a backcountry skier was caught and killed in an avalanche in the Anthracite Range, near the town of Crested Butte. The avalanche was triggered on a very steep north-facing slope at 11,200 feet. Our deepest condolences to the deceased skier''s family, friends, and community.

Triggering an avalanche from a wind-loaded area below ridges or in cross-loaded gullies could break above you or wider than you expect, and travel quickly down the slope with a firm crust below. Veer around places with a smooth, pillow-like appearance and be willing to adjust your travels if you notice the snow surface transition from soft to stiff, or you observe cracking in the snow. Safer travel options exists below treeline.Triggering a deeper breaking avalanche has become less likely, but is still a lingering potential in shallow areas on steeper slopes at upper elevations.

This will happen first on easterly-facing slopes, then follow the sun to the west throughout the day. Wet snow avalanches will be more plentiful on slopes steeper than about 35 degrees, and on those with exposed rocks, or cliff bands. Wetting of the storm snow can happen quickly in the spring, so ramp up your avalanche awareness if you see rollerballs or the snow surface gets wet and gloppy. Long-running slides on slopes with 8 or more inches of new snow could grow large enough to be more dangerous – especially if you get knocked over or stuffed in a terrain trap.On northerly-facing slopes above treeline, you might trigger a shallow avalanche where winds formed a slightly stiffer slab over a hard, refrozen snow surface. Broader slab formation likely exists below ridgelines and in cross-loaded gullies, and where avalanches may be larger.

East-facing slopes above treeline seem to be the most active, but we have seen avalanches on a variety of mostly above-treeline slopes.

Characteristics of more dangerous slopes are- very steep slopes (steeper than 40 degrees), slopes with a lot of exposed rock, and slopes with a shallow snowpack..Large, overhanging cornices are also a concern. If they fall onto the slope below, a larger avalanche can result as the weight of the fallen cornice gauges deeply into the snowpack. These cornices are also a threat if you are walking on ridgelines, as they can break much further back than you expect, especially during this current stretch of above-normal temperatures.The snowpack and avalanche conditions are not as straightforward as we would like for early June.

You can check current weather conditions across Colorado on our Weather Stations page.Here is information about common avalanche problems you might encounter over the summer:Wet Slab and Loose Wet Avalanches: As the snow heats up and begins to melt, water moving through the snowpack can produce avalanches. Watch the overnight low temperatures at high-elevation weather stations, but remember that air temperature, cloud cover, and wind all affect how the snow freezes each night. Regardless of what wet avalanche you are worried about, remember to stay off and out from under steep snow-covered slopes when you start to sink into the wet snow more than about 6 inches.The most common wet avalanches are loose wet, sluff, or point-release avalanches. These are most dangerous if they push you off a cliff or into rocks, trees, or a gully. Travel when the snow surface is colder and stronger. Plan your trips to avoid crossing on or under very steep slopes in the afternoon. Move to colder, shadier slopes once the snow surface turns slushy. Avoid steep, sunlit slopes above terrain traps, cliff areas, and long-sustained steep pitches.Wet Slab avalanches are more dangerous. These often occur when liquid meltwater weakens the bond between the slab and the surface below (snow or ground). The snow conditions that produce Wet Slab avalanches last longest on high-elevation, northerly slopes as we move into summer. Look at the old snow layers to see if they are still dry or turning to coarse springtime snow.Cornice Fall: Throughout the winter, strong winds build large overhanging snow features along ridgelines. These cornices can break off at any time of year, but periods of significant temperature warm-up during the spring are times to be particularly aware of. Cornices can never be trusted; avoiding them is necessary for safe backcountry travel. Stay well back from the edge of cornices. Avoid areas underneath cornices. If your route goes under one, use a similar approach as Wet Slab avalanches, look for a good overnight freeze, and try to get past them early in the day. Remember that the sun may hit them earlier than it hits the slopes below them.Storm Slabs, Wind Slabs, and Loose Dry Avalanches: Most avalanches happen during or right after a snowstorm. Later in the spring and throughout the summer, snowstorms are less likely. However, every time new snow falls, and the wind drifts it through the terrain, these avalanches are possible. It is easier to trigger avalanches when new snow falls on hard, icy surfaces, so a summer snowstorm can produce many small avalanches if it falls onto old snow. Even small avalanches are dangerous if they push you off a cliff or into rocks, trees, or a gully. The best way to manage these avalanches in the summer is to have a current weather forecast, recognize when there is enough new snow to produce storm avalanches, and select terrain that minimizes your exposure to the risk."
2024-08-07,earlySeason,earlySeason,earlySeason,"Summer Avalanche SafetyAvalanches are possible in the mountains of Colorado whenever you find snow on a steep slope. You should consider the consequences of being caught in an avalanche before crossing any steep, snow-covered slope. We will update the Field Report and Avalanche Observations as information comes in, so please send us your observations.You can get up-to-date point weather forecasts on our Weather Forecasts page by clicking on the map or searching for a location. You can also get model forecasts on our Point Forecasts page and Model Forecast page. You can check current weather conditions across Colorado on our Weather Stations page.Here is information about common avalanche problems you might encounter over the summer:Wet Slab and Loose Wet Avalanches: As the snow heats up and begins to melt, water moving through the snowpack can produce avalanches. Watch the overnight low temperatures at high-elevation weather stations, but remember that air temperature, cloud cover, and wind all affect how the snow freezes each night. Regardless of what wet avalanche you are worried about, remember to stay off and out from under steep snow-covered slopes when you start to sink into the wet snow more than about 6 inches.The most common wet avalanches are loose wet, sluff, or point-release avalanches. These are most dangerous if they push you off a cliff or into rocks, trees, or a gully. Travel when the snow surface is colder and stronger. Plan your trips to avoid crossing on or under very steep slopes in the afternoon. Move to colder, shadier slopes once the snow surface turns slushy. Avoid steep, sunlit slopes above terrain traps, cliff areas, and long-sustained steep pitches.Wet Slab avalanches are more dangerous. These often occur when liquid meltwater weakens the bond between the slab and the surface below (snow or ground). The snow conditions that produce Wet Slab avalanches last longest on high-elevation, northerly slopes as we move into summer. Look at the old snow layers to see if they are still dry or turning to coarse springtime snow.Cornice Fall: Throughout the winter, strong winds build large overhanging snow features along ridgelines. These cornices can break off at any time of year, but periods of significant temperature warm-up during the spring are times to be particularly aware of. Cornices can never be trusted; avoiding them is necessary for safe backcountry travel. Stay well back from the edge of cornices. Avoid areas underneath cornices. If your route goes under one, use a similar approach as Wet Slab avalanches, look for a good overnight freeze, and try to get past them early in the day. Remember that the sun may hit them earlier than it hits the slopes below them. Wind Slabs, and Loose Dry Avalanches: Most avalanches happen during or right after a snowstorm.

They often form when new snow falls with light winds or in wind-sheltered areas. They typically last for a few days. You can reduce your risk from Storm Slabs by waiting a day or two after a storm before venturing into steep terrain. Storm slabs are most dangerous on slopes with terrain traps like gullies or cliffs, or slopes that end in timber or scree fields.With Wind Slab avalanches, wind-drifted snow forms the cohesive layer (a slab). Wind typically transports snow from the upwind sides of terrain features and deposits snow on the downwind side. Drifted snow is often smooth and rounded, and sometimes sounds hollow. They form in specific areas leeward of terrain features. You can reduce your risk from Wind Slab avalanches by sticking to wind-sheltered or wind-scoured areas and avoiding drifted spots.Loose Dry avalanches are a release of dry, unconsolidated snow. They start at a point and entrain snow as they move downhill, forming a fan-shaped avalanche. Loose Dry avalanches are usually relatively harmless to people. They can be dangerous if they catch and carry you into or over terrain traps like gullies or cliffs, or slopes that end in timber or scree fields.Avalanche conditions can change rapidly during snow storms, wind storms, or rapid temperature change.

There isn''t yet enough snow to raise serious avalanche concerns in most places, but the San Juan Mountains could pick up enough snow by the end of the weekend to make small avalanches a concern. In areas that pick up more than around a foot of new snow, it''s time to start thinking about avalanches on steep, snow-covered slopes. Once snow piles up or drifts deep enough to obscure the ground cover, avalanches are possible. This doesn''t take much on grassy slopes or steep rock slabs. Nearly every fall, avalanches catch eager riders and late-season hikers off-guard. Hunters traveling through the high country need to exercise caution on steep, snow covered terrain. Please be thinking avalanche if you visit steep slopes in the high country. Below we describe some considerations for early-season fall avalanche concerns.We will update the Statewide Avalanche Conditions as necessary. On November 1, 2024, we will resume our daily weather and backcountry avalanche forecasts.If you are going into the Colorado high country use our Weather Stations by Zone page to check current conditions.Avalanche and Snowpack DiscussionAvalanches are possible in the mountainous areas of Colorado whenever you find snow on a steep slope. In general, you should consider the consequences of being caught in an avalanche before you cross any steep, snow-covered slope, but below are some avalanche problems you may encounter this fall.Most avalanches happen during or right after a snowstorm. However, any time new snow falls and the wind moves it through the terrain, avalanches are possible. New snow often has a hard time adhering to hard, icy old snow surfaces, so a fall snowstorm can produce small avalanches if it falls onto old snow, grassy areas or rock slabs. The best way to manage these avalanches in the fall is to have a current weather forecast, recognize when there is enough snow to produce avalanches, and select terrain that minimizes your exposure to the risk. We will update the Field Reports as information comes in, so please send us your observations.Storms Slab avalanches are the release of a soft cohesive layer (a slab) composed of new snow that breaks within the storm snow or on the old snow surface. They often form when new snow falls with light winds or in wind-sheltered areas. They typically last for a few days. You can reduce your risk from Storm Slabs by waiting a day or two after a storm before venturing into steep terrain. Storm slabs are most dangerous on slopes with terrain traps like gullies or cliffs, or slopes that end in timber or scree fields.With Wind Slab avalanches, wind-drifted snow forms the cohesive layer (a slab). Wind typically transports snow from the upwind sides of terrain features and deposits snow on the downwind side. Drifted snow is often smooth and rounded, and sometimes sounds hollow. They form in specific areas leeward of terrain features. You can reduce your risk from Wind Slab avalanches by sticking to wind-sheltered or wind-scoured areas and avoiding drifted spots.Loose Dry avalanches are a release of dry, unconsolidated snow. They start at a point and entrain snow as they move downhill, forming a fan-shaped avalanche. Loose Dry avalanches are usually relatively harmless to people. They can be dangerous if they catch and carry you into or over terrain traps like gullies or cliffs, or slopes that end in timber or scree fields.Avalanche conditions can change rapidly during snow storms, wind storms, or rapid temperature change.

2024-10-31,earlySeason,earlySeason,earlySeason,"Fall Avalanche SafetyBe careful if you plan to go into the mountains over the next few days, especially if you are traveling in the Southern Mountains, where an early-season storm deposited 12 to 16 inches of snow in some spots. Northerly-facing slopes, especially at upper elevations, are the most likely places to trigger an avalanche across all of Colorado''s Mountains. If you find more than about 8 inches of new snow resting on old snow from previous storms, you should avoid steep slopes and terrain traps. Nearly every fall, avalanches catch eager riders, late-season hikers, and hunters off-guard. If you find continuous snow on steep slopes, you can trigger an avalanche.Snowfall will continue on Tuesday, adding to the accumulations. Favored areas may pick up an additional 4 to 6 inches of snow before the storm pushes out of the area on Tuesday evening.Regular daily forecasts start this Thursday and continue through May 2025.If you are going into the Colorado high country, check current conditions on our Weather Stations by Zone page.

Most of these avalanches will be small but they can still knock you over and take you for a dangerous ride. Identify and avoid wind-drifted snow, primarily found on northwest through north to east-facing slopes. You can identify wind-drifted slopes by the rounded, wave-like appearance on the snow surface and the hard, hollow feel often associated with cracks shooting several feet in front of you when traveling across them."

2024-11-01,low,low,low,"Avalanche conditions are generally safe. Most slopes lack enough snow to trigger an avalanche. If you find a steep slope with continuous snow cover where the most recent snow drifted onto older October snow (or even a permanent snowfield), you might trigger a small avalanche. The most likely place to find this combination is on high-elevation shaded slopes just below ridgelines or in gullies. Unfortunately, the places with enough snow to ride are likely the same places where you could trigger an avalanche. Look for signs of drifted snow like textured pillows or fresh cornices. Cracking in drifted snow is an indication to avoid steep slopes. Think about the consequences of getting caught in any avalanche before committing to a slope.

Most of these avalanches will be small early in the day but by the afternoon they can grow large enough to bury you. For safer travel options start and end your day in the backcountry early before snow accumulations exceed much more than a foot or just stick to slopes less than about 30 degrees steep without steep slopes overhead."

At higher elevations, you may trigger a small avalanche in wind-drifted snow; however, the greater risk is triggering a large avalanche that breaks on a weak snow layer one to three feet deep and grows large enough to bury you. You are most likely to trigger one of these dangerous avalanches where it’s easier to impact the weak snow layer—near treeline, where the weak snow is less deep and the overlying snow is softer, or above treeline along the edges or bottom of a slope, where most of the snow is firm and wind-affected, but the weak layer is more vulnerable near the slope’s edge. For safer travel, seek wind-sheltered terrain below treeline."

You're unlikely to see warning signs like cracking or collapsing before you trigger an avalanche. If you venture into avalanche terrain, stack the odds in your favor, by choosing slopes that do not end in terrain traps such as gullies, cliffs, or trees."
2025-03-02,moderate,moderate,moderate,"The avalanche danger has dropped to MODERATE (Level 2 of 5), but the consequences of triggering an avalanche have not. Any avalanche you trigger can be large, wide, and deadly. Multiple people can ride a slope before it slides. You're unlikely to see warning signs like cracking or collapsing before you trigger an avalanche. If you venture into avalanche terrain, stack the odds in your favor, by choosing slopes that do not end in terrain traps such as gullies, cliffs, or trees. There is a chance of wet avalanches in very steep and rocky terrain. Avoid steep, sunbaked slopes if the snow becomes unsupportable or if you observe rollerballs in the surface snow."
2025-03-01,considerable,considerable,moderate,"You can trigger very large avalanches if you find the wrong spot on a slope. There are suspect slopes on most aspects, but northwest through east to southeast slopes at upper elevations are the most dangerous. With a recently built slab about 3 feet thick, it can be hard to find a trigger point, but when you do, the avalanche will be deadly. Multiple people can ride a slope before it slides. You're unlikely to see any warning signs like cracking or collapsing before you trigger an avalanche. The best way to manage this hazard is to avoid slopes steeper than about 30 degrees. For visual impact, here's a montage of last week's large avalanches from around the state. Above-freezing temperatures, sunny skies, and light winds mean the snow surface could become wet on sunny slopes. You can trigger a slide where you find wet, cohesionless snow on steep slopes. Avoid steep slopes if you're sinking up to your ankles in wet snow. Rollerballs and point-releases are indications the surface is becoming wet."
2025-02-19,considerable,considerable,considerable,"There are lots of places you can trigger a big avalanche. Intense westerly winds created drifts of snow about 3 feet deep or more on leeward slopes. You can trigger slides where you find these drifts on steep leeward slopes at upper elevations. You can also trigger slides at lower elevations where the storm snow rests on weak snow, especially on drifted, open slopes. Avalanches in the storm snow will likely be large enough to bury you on their own. Don't forget they can also be the trigger for avalanches that break on deeper weak layers and become nearly unsurvivable. Make conservative terrain choices and avoid traveling on or below slopes steeper than about 30 degrees."
2025-02-18,high,high,considerable,"An Avalanche Warning is in effect for the Summit area. Heavy snow and strong winds will create very dangerous avalanche conditions starting early Monday and lasting through Tuesday. Large avalanches will be easy to trigger, and some could release naturally. You can trigger avalanches in the new snow large enough to bury you. Some avalanches will break deeper in the snowpack, propagating broader and larger than expected. You could trigger an avalanche from a distance or below. Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended during this time."
2025-02-16,considerable,considerable,moderate,"A Special Avalanche Advisory for much of Colorado. Heavy snow and strong winds dramatically changed avalanche conditions. You can easily trigger large, deadly avalanches throughout President’s Day weekend. You will most likely trigger an avalanche where you find more than 8 inches of new or wind-drifted snow. You will find firm pillows of rounded snow below ridgelines, terrain breaks, and cross-loaded gullies. Cracking or collapsing in the new snow are signs you have found surface instability, and you should avoid steep slopes. These avalanches may stay confined to the surface snow or step down to the ground, as we have seen close to Cameron Pass recently. This is more likely in steep rocky terrain with a shallow snowpack. You can find safer travel on slopes less than about 30 degrees in steepness."
2025-02-15,high,considerable,considerable,"Avalanche conditions are dangerous. Strong winds on Saturday afternoon make things worse. These westerly winds will drift snow into thick slabs on numerous slopes, especially those directly below ridgetop. If you trigger an avalanche in drifted snow, it can step down to a much larger, potentially deadly avalanche. Another very large avalanche broke near the ground around Cameron Pass on Thursday, providing all the evidence we need to know that these dangerous avalanches are possible and increasing in frequency. This is true from the Wyoming border through Summit County."
2025-02-14,considerable,considerable,moderate,"You can trigger avalanches where the wind has drifted snow into hard, cohesive slabs. A small avalanche in drifted snow can turn into a larger one if it steps down to more deeply buried weak layers. Stick to slopes with soft snow that are sheltered from the wind."
2025-02-13,moderate,moderate,low,"You can trigger an avalanche in drifted slabs at upper elevations. Soft drifts over 8 inches deep, or hard drifts that support your weight are the most suspect. Cracking in the new snow is a sign you could trigger a slide. Avoid lens-shaped pillows of snow where you see them on steep slopes directly below ridges and in gullies. Avalanches can step down into older drifts and grow larger. Some could break in weak snow near the ground. You might not see any warning signs before you trigger a deeper avalanche. Drifted rocky slopes with variable snow cover are the most likely place to trigger a deeper avalanche. Look for safer riding on slopes less than about 30 degrees and in the trees sheltered from the wind."
2025-02-12,moderate,moderate,low,"You can trigger an avalanche where new snow drifts into slabs at upper elevations. Areas that get 6 inches of snow or more will be the most dangerous. Light winds in the morning will begin to drift snow efficiently as the day progresses. Avalanches can step down into older, denser drifts and grow larger. Some could break in weak snow near the ground. Cracking in the new snow is a sign you could trigger a slide. However, you might not see any warning signs before you trigger a deeper avalanche. Multiple people can ride a slope before triggering a slide. Avoid lens-shaped pillows of snow where you see them on steep slopes directly below ridges and in gullies. Especially slopes with variable snow cover and exposed obstacles that can act as trigger points for deeper avalanches. Look for safer riding on slopes less than about 30 degrees and in the trees sheltered from the wind."
2025-02-11,moderate,moderate,low,"Slopes with thick drifts of snow are the most dangerous. You can trigger an avalanche in drifted surface snow that steps down to weak layers close to the ground. Avoid rounded, lens-shaped pillows of firm snow. Especially where you see them on steep slopes directly below ridges and in gullies. You will not get any warning signs of a deeper avalanche, and multiple people could take a run before it slides. You can reduce your chances of triggering a deeper slide by traveling on consistently angled slopes without many trigger points. You can find safer riding on slopes less than about 30 degrees and in the trees sheltered from the wind."
2025-02-04,moderate,moderate,moderate,"Slopes with recently drifted snow are the most hazardous. Avalanches in recently drifted snow can step down to the ground and grow even larger. You will find these areas below ridgelines and along gullies. Shallow slopes with exposed rocks and trees are the most likely place to find a weak area and trigger a deeper avalanche. You will not get any warning signs, and multiple people could ride a slope before you find a weak area. You can find safer riding on slopes protected from the wind and slopes less than about 30 degrees. Above-freezing temperatures tomorrow will likely cause the snow to become wet and sluff off steep, sunny slopes. Avalanches could gouge deeper into the snowpack and grow larger as they run. If you sink to your ankles in wet, gloppy snow or see rollerballs, avoid being on, or below, steep slopes."
2025-02-03,moderate,moderate,moderate,"Slopes with recently drifted snow are the most hazardous. Trigging an avalanche in rounded pillows of firm snow at the surface could penetrate deeper weak layers. You are most likely to trigger a deeper slide on steep, rocky slopes connected to drifted snow. Multiple people could ride a slope before a slide is triggered. You can find safer riding on slopes protected from the wind and lower-angled slopes. Sunny skies and above-freezing temperatures tomorrow will likely cause the snow to become wet and sluff off steep, sunny slopes. These avalanches could gouge deeper into the snowpack and grow larger as they run. If you sink up to your ankles in wet, gloppy surface snow or see rollerballs, you should steer clear of steep slopes."

2025-01-22,moderate,moderate,moderate,"Westerly winds continue to drift snow into slabs on easterly-facing slopes. You can trigger an avalanche in this drifted snow. Steep wind-loaded east-facing slopes that sit directly below ridgetop are the most likely places to trigger an avalanche. Avalanches in drifted snow can grow large as they step down to more deeply buried weak layers. You are unlikely to get any warning signs like cracking or collapsing before triggering one of these deadly slides. To lower your chances of triggering an avalanche, stick to slopes sheltered from the wind with softer snow"
2025-01-14,considerable,considerable,moderate,"Continued reports of collapsing sounds indicate the snowpack is still dangerous and you can trigger large avalanches. The most dangerous slopes are north through southeast-facing slopes located directly below the ridgetop. The only way to avoid tangling with one of these large and destructive avalanches is to steer clear of steep slopes. Obvious signs of instability, such as shooting cracks and sounds of the snowpack collapsing, are decreasing. Don't mistake the absence of these warning signs for safer conditions."
