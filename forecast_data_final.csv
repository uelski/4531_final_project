2024-06-11,earlySeason,earlySeason,earlySeason,"Current Conditions This past weekend’s Special Avalanche Advisory has expired but that doesn’t mean avalanche conditions are safe. You can trigger wet avalanches if you are on steep slopes after melt-freeze crusts become unsupportable and you are sinking into wet snow. Start your day early and end early to reduce your risk of avalanches. Have a plan to avoid steep slopes, and get back to the trailhead, should conditions worsen quicker than you think. Avalanche and Snowpack DiscussionThe beginning of the week (June 10 – June 11) brings slightly cooler temperatures than the blazing hot temperatures we experienced from June 6 to June 9. Although temperatures are cooler, more overnight cloud cover is forecast. Overnight cloud cover is problematic. Even with recent hot temperatures, clear skies at night helped to form supportable, surface melt-freeze crusts that allowed for a few hours of early-morning safe-travel conditions. Thick cloud cover overnight means that crusts won’t form and a window of safe travel may be nonexistent. This is something that you will have to monitor by observing cloud cover and being ready to change your plans if you get on the snow and find mushy, wet conditions before the sun even rises. Over the past few days, we had a few reports of large avalanches. One was a cornice-triggered avalanche near Loveland Pass and also a large Wet Slab avalanche in Rocky Mountain National Park on Mount Ida on a north-facing slope. Avalanche activity doesn’t seem to be widespread, but it’s hard to tell right now with fewer people recreating on snow in the mountains. The concern is for the intermittent reports of larger avalanches that continue to come in. As mentioned above, if you avoid steep terrain once surface crusts melt, you can easily avoid avalanches.It is hard to pinpoint a specific aspect and elevation where the most dangerous slopes are. East-facing slopes above treeline seem to be the most active, but we have seen avalanches on a variety of mostly above-treeline slopes. It is easier to describe the most dangerous slopes by certain slope characteristics than a precise aspect and elevation. Characteristics of more dangerous slopes are- very steep slopes (steeper than 40 degrees), slopes with a lot of exposed rock, and slopes with a shallow snowpack..Large, overhanging cornices are also a concern. If they fall onto the slope below, a larger avalanche can result as the weight of the fallen cornice gauges deeply into the snowpack. These cornices are also a threat if you are walking on ridgelines, as they can break much further back than you expect, especially during this current stretch of above-normal temperatures.The snowpack and avalanche conditions are not as straightforward as we would like for early June. Fortunately, it is easy to see and feel worsening conditions while you are in the backcountry. You need supportable crusts to travel right now.

2024-07-09,earlySeason,earlySeason,earlySeason,"Summer Avalanche SafetyAvalanches are possible in the mountains of Colorado whenever you find snow on a steep slope. You should consider the consequences of being caught in an avalanche before crossing any steep, snow-covered slope. We will update the Field Report and Avalanche Observations as information comes in, so please send us your observations.You can get up-to-date point weather forecasts on our Weather Forecasts page by clicking on the map or searching for a location. You can also get model forecasts on our Point Forecasts page and Model Forecast page. You can check current weather conditions across Colorado on our Weather Stations page.Here is information about common avalanche problems you might encounter over the summer:Wet Slab and Loose Wet Avalanches: As the snow heats up and begins to melt, water moving through the snowpack can produce avalanches. Watch the overnight low temperatures at high-elevation weather stations, but remember that air temperature, cloud cover, and wind all affect how the snow freezes each night. Regardless of what wet avalanche you are worried about, remember to stay off and out from under steep snow-covered slopes when you start to sink into the wet snow more than about 6 inches.The most common wet avalanches are loose wet, sluff, or point-release avalanches. These are most dangerous if they push you off a cliff or into rocks, trees, or a gully. Travel when the snow surface is colder and stronger. Plan your trips to avoid crossing on or under very steep slopes in the afternoon. Move to colder, shadier slopes once the snow surface turns slushy. Avoid steep, sunlit slopes above terrain traps, cliff areas, and long-sustained steep pitches.Wet Slab avalanches are more dangerous. These often occur when liquid meltwater weakens the bond between the slab and the surface below (snow or ground). The snow conditions that produce Wet Slab avalanches last longest on high-elevation, northerly slopes as we move into summer. Look at the old snow layers to see if they are still dry or turning to coarse springtime snow.Cornice Fall: Throughout the winter, strong winds build large overhanging snow features along ridgelines. These cornices can break off at any time of year, but periods of significant temperature warm-up during the spring are times to be particularly aware of. Cornices can never be trusted; avoiding them is necessary for safe backcountry travel. Stay well back from the edge of cornices. Avoid areas underneath cornices. If your route goes under one, use a similar approach as Wet Slab avalanches, look for a good overnight freeze, and try to get past them early in the day. Remember that the sun may hit them earlier than it hits the slopes below them.Storm Slabs, Wind Slabs, and Loose Dry Avalanches: Most avalanches happen during or right after a snowstorm. Later in the spring and throughout the summer, snowstorms are less likely. However, every time new snow falls, and the wind drifts it through the terrain, these avalanches are possible. It is easier to trigger avalanches when new snow falls on hard, icy surfaces, so a summer snowstorm can produce many small avalanches if it falls onto old snow. Even small avalanches are dangerous if they push you off a cliff or into rocks, trees, or a gully. The best way to manage these avalanches in the summer is to have a current weather forecast, recognize when there is enough new snow to produce storm avalanches, and select terrain that minimizes your exposure to the risk.",0.0,0,0,"summer avalanche safetyavalanches possible mountains colorado whenever find snow steep slope . consider consequences caught avalanche crossing steep , snow-covered slope . update field report avalanche observations information comes , please send us observations.you get up-to-date point weather forecasts weather forecasts page clicking map searching location . also get model forecasts point forecasts page model forecast page . check current weather conditions across colorado weather stations page.here information common avalanche problems might encounter summer : wet slab loose wet avalanches : snow heats begins melt , water moving snowpack produce avalanches . watch overnight low temperatures high-elevation weather stations , remember air temperature , cloud cover , wind affect snow freezes night . regardless wet avalanche worried , remember stay steep snow-covered slopes start sink wet snow 6 inches.the common wet avalanches loose wet , sluff , point-release avalanches . dangerous push cliff rocks , trees , gully . travel snow surface colder stronger . plan trips avoid crossing steep slopes afternoon . move colder , shadier slopes snow surface turns slushy . avoid steep , sunlit slopes terrain traps , cliff areas , long-sustained steep pitches.wet slab avalanches dangerous . often occur liquid meltwater weakens bond slab surface ( snow ground ) . snow conditions produce wet slab avalanches last longest high-elevation , northerly slopes move summer . look old snow layers see still dry turning coarse springtime snow.cornice fall : throughout winter , strong winds build large overhanging snow features along ridgelines . cornices break time year , periods significant temperature warm-up spring times particularly aware . cornices never trusted ; avoiding necessary safe backcountry travel . stay well back edge cornices . avoid areas underneath cornices . route goes one , use similar approach wet slab avalanches , look good overnight freeze , try get past early day . remember sun may hit earlier hits slopes them.storm slabs , wind slabs , loose dry avalanches : avalanches happen right snowstorm . later spring throughout summer , snowstorms less likely . however , every time new snow falls , wind drifts terrain , avalanches possible . easier trigger avalanches new snow falls hard , icy surfaces , summer snowstorm produce many small avalanches falls onto old snow . even small avalanches dangerous push cliff rocks , trees , gully . best way manage avalanches summer current weather forecast , recognize enough new snow produce storm avalanches , select terrain minimizes exposure risk ."

2024-08-07,earlySeason,earlySeason,earlySeason,"Summer Avalanche SafetyAvalanches are possible in the mountains of Colorado whenever you find snow on a steep slope. You should consider the consequences of being caught in an avalanche before crossing any steep, snow-covered slope. We will update the Field Report and Avalanche Observations as information comes in, so please send us your observations.You can get up-to-date point weather forecasts on our Weather Forecasts page by clicking on the map or searching for a location. You can also get model forecasts on our Point Forecasts page and  Model Forecast page. You can check current weather conditions across Colorado on our  Weather Stations page.Here is information about common avalanche problems you might encounter over the summer:Wet Slab and Loose Wet Avalanches: As the snow heats up and begins to melt, water moving through the snowpack can produce avalanches. Watch the overnight low temperatures at high-elevation weather stations, but remember that air temperature, cloud cover, and wind all affect how the snow freezes each night. Regardless of what wet avalanche you are worried about, remember to stay off and out from under steep snow-covered slopes when you start to sink into the wet snow more than about 6 inches.The most common wet avalanches are loose wet, sluff, or point-release avalanches. These are most dangerous if they push you off a cliff or into rocks, trees, or a gully. Travel when the snow surface is colder and stronger. Plan your trips to avoid crossing on or under very steep slopes in the afternoon. Move to colder, shadier slopes once the snow surface turns slushy. Avoid steep, sunlit slopes above terrain traps, cliff areas, and long-sustained steep pitches.Wet Slab avalanches are more dangerous. These often occur when liquid meltwater weakens the bond between the slab and the surface below (snow or ground). The snow conditions that produce Wet Slab avalanches last longest on high-elevation, northerly slopes as we move into summer. Look at the old snow layers to see if they are still dry or turning to coarse springtime snow.Cornice Fall: Throughout the winter, strong winds build large overhanging snow features along ridgelines. These cornices can break off at any time of year, but periods of significant temperature warm-up during the spring are times to be particularly aware of. Cornices can never be trusted; avoiding them is necessary for safe backcountry travel. Stay well back from the edge of cornices. Avoid areas underneath cornices. If your route goes under one, use a similar approach as Wet Slab avalanches, look for a good overnight freeze, and try to get past them early in the day. Remember that the sun may hit them earlier than it hits the slopes below them.Storm Slabs, Wind Slabs, and  Avalanches: Most avalanches happen during or right after a snowstorm. Later in the spring and throughout the summer, snowstorms are less likely. However, every time new snow falls, and the wind drifts it through the terrain, these avalanches are possible. It is easier to trigger avalanches when new snow falls on hard, icy surfaces, so a summer snowstorm can produce many small avalanches if it falls onto old snow.

2024-10-09,earlySeason,earlySeason,earlySeason,"Fall Avalanche SafetyColorado is starting to see the first transient dustings of snow in the alpine. There isn''t yet enough snow to raise avalanche concerns, but it''s time to start thinking about avalanches on steep, snow-covered slopes once we get measurable snowfall. Once snow piles up or drifts deep enough to obscure the ground cover avalanches are possible. This doesn''t take much on grassy slopes or steep rock slabs. Nearly every fall, avalanches catch eager riders and late-season hikers off-guard. Hunters traveling through the high country need to exercise caution on steep, snow covered terrain. Please be thinking avalanche if you visit steep slopes in the high country. Below we describe some considerations for early-season fall avalanche concerns.We will update the Statewide Avalanche Conditions as necessary. On November 1, 2024, we will resume our daily weather and backcountry avalanche forecasts. If you are going into the Colorado high country use our Weather Stations by Zone page to check current conditions.Avalanche and Snowpack DiscussionAvalanches are possible in the mountainous areas of Colorado whenever you find snow on a steep slope. In general, you should consider the consequences of being caught in an avalanche before you cross any steep, snow-covered slope, but below are some avalanche problems you may encounter this fall.Most avalanches happen during or right after a snowstorm.

We will update the Field Reports as information comes in, so please send us your observations.Storms Slab avalanches are the release of a soft cohesive layer (a slab) composed of new snow that breaks within the storm snow or on the old snow surface. They often form when new snow falls with light winds or in wind-sheltered areas. They typically last for a few days. You can reduce your risk from Storm Slabs by waiting a day or two after a storm before venturing into steep terrain. Storm slabs are most dangerous on slopes with terrain traps like gullies or cliffs, or slopes that end in timber or scree fields.With Wind Slab avalanches, wind-drifted snow forms the cohesive layer (a slab). Wind typically transports snow from the upwind sides of terrain features and deposits snow on the downwind side. Drifted snow is often smooth and rounded, and sometimes sounds hollow. They form in specific areas leeward of terrain features. You can reduce your risk from Wind Slab avalanches by sticking to wind-sheltered or wind-scoured areas and avoiding drifted spots.Loose Dry avalanches are a release of dry, unconsolidated snow. They start at a point and entrain snow as they move downhill, forming a fan-shaped avalanche. Loose Dry avalanches are usually relatively harmless to people. They can be dangerous if they catch and carry you into or over terrain traps like gullies or cliffs, or slopes that end in timber or scree fields.Avalanche conditions can change rapidly during snow storms, wind storms, or rapid temperature change.

2024-10-14,earlySeason,earlySeason,earlySeason,"Fall Avalanche SafetyColorado is starting to see the first transient dustings of snow in the alpine. There isn''t yet enough snow to raise avalanche concerns, but it''s time to start thinking about avalanches on steep, snow-covered slopes once we get measurable snowfall. Once snow piles up or drifts deep enough to obscure the ground cover avalanches are possible. This doesn''t take much on grassy slopes or steep rock slabs. Nearly every fall, avalanches catch eager riders and late-season hikers off-guard. Hunters traveling through the high country need to exercise caution on steep, snow covered terrain. Please be thinking avalanche if you visit steep slopes in the high country. Below we describe some considerations for early-season fall avalanche concerns.We will update the Statewide Avalanche Conditions as necessary. On November 1, 2024, we will resume our daily weather and backcountry avalanche forecasts. If you are going into the Colorado high country use our Weather Stations by Zone page to check current conditions.Avalanche and Snowpack DiscussionAvalanches are possible in the mountainous areas of Colorado whenever you find snow on a steep slope. In general, you should consider the consequences of being caught in an avalanche before you cross any steep, snow-covered slope, but below are some avalanche problems you may encounter this fall.Most avalanches happen during or right after a snowstorm. However, any time new snow falls and the wind moves it through the terrain, avalanches are possible. New snow often has a hard time adhering to hard, icy old snow surfaces, so a fall snowstorm can produce small avalanches if it falls onto old snow, grassy areas or rock slabs. The best way to manage these avalanches in the fall is to have a current weather forecast, recognize when there is enough snow to produce avalanches, and select terrain that minimizes your exposure to the risk. We will update the Field Reports as information comes in, so please send us your observations.Storms Slab avalanches are the release of a soft cohesive layer (a slab) composed of new snow that breaks within the storm snow or on the old snow surface. They often form when new snow falls with light winds or in wind-sheltered areas. They typically last for a few days. You can reduce your risk from Storm Slabs by waiting a day or two after a storm before venturing into steep terrain. Storm slabs are most dangerous on slopes with terrain traps like gullies or cliffs, or slopes that end in timber or scree fields.With Wind Slab avalanches, wind-drifted snow forms the cohesive layer (a slab). Wind typically transports snow from the upwind sides of terrain features and deposits snow on the downwind side. Drifted snow is often smooth and rounded, and sometimes sounds hollow. They form in specific areas leeward of terrain features. You can reduce your risk from Wind Slab avalanches by sticking to wind-sheltered or wind-scoured areas and avoiding drifted spots.Loose Dry avalanches are a release of dry, unconsolidated snow. They start at a point and entrain snow as they move downhill, forming a fan-shaped avalanche. Loose Dry avalanches are usually relatively harmless to people. They can be dangerous if they catch and carry you into or over terrain traps like gullies or cliffs, or slopes that end in timber or scree fields.Avalanche conditions can change rapidly during snow storms, wind storms, or rapid temperature change.

2024-10-31,earlySeason,earlySeason,earlySeason,"Fall Avalanche SafetyBe careful if you plan to go into the mountains over the next few days, especially if you are traveling in the Southern Mountains, where an early-season storm deposited 12 to 16 inches of snow in some spots. Northerly-facing slopes, especially at upper elevations, are the most likely places to trigger an avalanche across all of Colorado''s Mountains. If you find more than about 8 inches of new snow resting on old snow from previous storms, you should avoid steep slopes and terrain traps. Nearly every fall, avalanches catch eager riders, late-season hikers, and hunters off-guard. If you find continuous snow on steep slopes, you can trigger an avalanche.Snowfall will continue on Tuesday, adding to the accumulations. Favored areas may pick up an additional 4 to 6 inches of snow before the storm pushes out of the area on Tuesday evening.Regular daily forecasts start this Thursday and continue through May 2025.If you are going into the Colorado high country, check current conditions on our Weather Stations by Zone page.
